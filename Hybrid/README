Formalization of hybrid IS5 - syntax similar to label-free version, but with
worlds as known in labeled version. It uses lists and permutations. This (only)
version of hybrid language is used in the main project directory and is imported
by Hybrid.v

Note
----
It requires Shared.v, PermutLib.v and ListLib.v from the main directory to be
compiled.
