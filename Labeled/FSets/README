This is the simplest formalization of Labeled IS5. It uses finite sets for
context representation - a simple method, but not without its limitations.
The biggest problem with such implementation is that it is hard to iterate
over context - in particular when dealing with language equivalence,
doing bucket sort over worlds in order to move from labeled to hybrid
language is complex, technical and hard to be subject of any reasoning.
Thus, this implementation is not used for equivalence, but is instead
left as it is the cleanest and simplest one - with no trouble coming
from the necessity of using permutations and with a very simple implementation
of variables, that uses de Bruijn indices instead of locally nameless.

Note
----
It requires Shared.v from the main directory to be compiled.
