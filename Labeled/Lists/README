Formalization of labeled IS5 using lists and permutations. It is compatible with
the implementation of hybrid language and label-free language in the sense of
context rewriting. This version of labeled language is used in the main project
directory with the prefix L (so, LSyntax, LSubstitution, LSemantics and a
library LOkLib).

Note
----
It requires Shared.v and PermutLib.v from the main directory to be compiled.
